* What is IP address?
 Every machine on a network has a unique identifier or IP(internet protocol)
The IP address is similar to your phone number. Your phone number is a unique set of numbers that determines your phone so other people can call you.
Similarly, an IP address is a unique set of numbers that determine your computer so that it can send and receive data from other computers.
Currently, most IP addresses consist of four sets of numbers, separated by dots. 192.168.1.42 is an example of an IP address.*/
