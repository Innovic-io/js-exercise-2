// Example 25

/*
*CommonJS and AMD are specifications (or formats) on how modules and their dependencies should be declared in javascript applications.
* The definition of the asynchronous module (AMD) supports the asynchronous loading of modules which is convenient for working with the modules in the browser.
*
CommonJS loads modules synchronously and is therefore most often used to work with modules on the server side in the node.js environment. Although it is not planned to work in the browser, with the help of the "bundler module" it is possible to customize CommonJS work in the browser.
